---> import { createSlice,nanoid } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
Explaination:
            we have imported createSlice which is used to make the slices 
            and nanoid for ginving unique id.

--->  const initialState={
        todos:[
            {
                id:1,text:"Hello World"
            }
        ]
    }
Explaination:   
            This is the initialState where all the todos which are already there exist.Simply understand as prototype.


--->   export const todoslice=createSlice({
        name:'todo',
        initialState,
        reducers:{
            addTodo:(state,action)=>{
                const todo={
                    id:nanoid,
                    text:action.payload
                }
                //now pushing the new todo in our initialstate

                state.todos.push(todo)
            }
            removeTodo:(state,action)=>{
            state.todos=state.todos.filter((todo)=>todo.id!==action.payload)
        }
        }
Explaination: 
            Here cration of slice is being done.where name indicates the names of the slices it is syntax
            >>initialState is giving the access of all existing todos.
            >>reducers acts as a functions which posses all the functionalitis.
            >> addTodo:(state,action)
                        Here state has the access of all priviou todos and action represent the action is to be done or the value coming from the UI.
            >> const todo={
                    id=nanoid,
                    text=action.payload 
                } 
                Here text=action.payload.text should be there since same name so only 
                      text=action.payload is used it is giving the access of the text.
            
            >>  state.todos.push(todo):Adding the newly addes todo to the state means the intialState where all todos were there            

---> export const{addTodo,removeTodo,updateTodo}=todoslice.actions
Explaination: 
            Exporting the functionality for the components so that they can acces these method.

--->  export default todoslice.reducer
Explaination: 
            Since store must have the access of all these reducers.
